# Adapter Pattern

An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.

The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects. It's usually implemented once the application is designed.
